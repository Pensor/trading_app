## Open, High, Low, Close

The entire logic for my model is based off a deep understanding of how a candlestick forms or OHLC / OLHC.

### OLHC (Bullish Candle)

A bullish expansion candle will open and create a low first, creating the wick of the higher time frame candle. Once the wick has formed, price will expand away creating the body. We do not want to see price open and trade higher first.

### OHLC (Bearish Candle)

A bearish expansion candle will open and create a high first, creating the wick of the higher time frame candle. Once the wick has formed, price will expand away creating the body. We do not want to see price open and trade lower first.

### Positive Conditions

All expansion candles in the market form small opposing runs. This small wick allows for a large range body of the candle. The less time it takes to manipulate (create the wick), the more time the candle has to distribute (create the body). This acts as a filter for high probability conditions.

### Negative Conditions

All reversal or indecision candles in the market form large opposing runs. This large wick does not support expansion. The candle took too much time to manipulate (create the wick), not leaving enough time for price to distribute (create the body). This acts as a filter for avoiding low probability conditions.

## Expansion Alignment

True expansion occurs when all time frames are aligned in one direction. The goal of this section is to show you the process I use to achieve this.

### Trading Away From Key Level

Once a key level is hit, and the anticipated high of day (HOD) or low of day (LOD) has formed (wick of higher time frame candle), Aim to align multiple time frame expansion candles in the same direction.

### Wait For Expansion Support

If the higher time frame candle in which price is currently trading does not support expansion, wait for the next candle to open to align with the expansion.

### Lower Time Frame Model Alignment

Align the lower timeframe model with the higher timeframe expansion candle. If the current higher timeframe candle does not support expansion, wait for the next higher timeframe candle to open and confirm expansion. Once the higher timeframe candle is aligned, price is more likely to move away from the key level.

## Reversal Formation

There are various reversal formations to look for.

### Reversal Types

C1 hits a key level, C2 forms reversal candle, wait for expansion candle in C3.

C2 hits a key level and forms a reversal candle, wait for expansion candle in C3.

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_1_3_1.avif)

C1 hits a key level, C2 forms a reversal into expansion candle off of C1 high/low. A small wick supports expansion.

C2 opens near key level and forms a reversal into expansion candle off C1 high/low. A small wick supports expansion.

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_1_3_2.avif)

C2 hits key level but does not close reversal candle. C3 Does not sweep C2 high/low but instead expands.

### Example (4H Timeframe and Above)

C1 hits key level and closes expansion candle

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_1_3_4.avif)

C2 forms a small opposing run reversing off C1 low. This small wick supports expansion higher.
