## Opposing Candles for Point of Interest

Opposing close candles will be used as a point of interest for where swing formations are established. Opposing candles are only used if there are no high / low or fair value gap to be used as a POI.

Opposing candles formed and validated on a close through.

Price trades into the opposing candles and has a candle 2 closure within candle 1 range.

Candle 2 closure at the opposing candle gives anticipation of candle 3 expansion.

## Highs & Lows for Point of Interest

Highs and lows will be used as a point of interest for where swing formations are established.


High or low is swept and candle 2 closes back into the range.

Candle 3 is an expansion away from the previously swept high or low in respect to candle 2.

## Fair Value Gaps for Point of Interest

Fair value gaps will be used as a point of interest for where swing formations are established.


While the fair value gap is being retested, entries are not taken within candle 1 as the swing formation is yet to be confirmed in candle 2 or candle 3.

Candle 2 closure confirms the swing point within the fair value gap.

Candle 3 is an expansion away from the fair value gap in respect to candle 2.
