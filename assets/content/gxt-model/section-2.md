## 4 Hour Profiling

### 2am Reversal

When previous 4H candle hits a 4H key level and closes as an expansion candle, seek the 2:00am 4H reversal into expansion candle. This candle reverses off the previous candles high or low, forming a wick and expanding away, creating the low or high of day (LOD/HOD)

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_4_1.avif)

### 6am Continuation

With a 2:00am Reversal forming the HOD/LOD, a continuation can be found at 6:00am 4H candle.

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_4_2.avif)

### 6am Reversal

When the previous 4H candle hits a 4H key level, look to trade the 6:00am 4H reversal into expansion candle. This candle reverses off the previous candles high or low, forming the wick or HOD/LOD

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_4_3.avif)

### 10am Continuation

With 2:00am or 6:00am reversal forming the HOD/LOD, 10am 4H candle continuation can be used.

### 10am Reversal

With the previous 4H candle hitting a 4H key level, the 10am 4H reversal into expansion candle provides opportunity. This candle reverses off the previous candles high or low, forming the wick and LOD / HOD

## Ideal Profile

The ideal profile occurs when the previous session(s) consolidate or retrace.

The high or low of day wick forms from manipulation of a 1H/4H swing high or low, creating a protected swing with the candle to expand away from which forms the candle body. Pair the manipulation with either a volatility driver or SMT.

### Ideal London Reversal

Ideal London reversal profile occurs when Asia session consolidates or retraces. The high or low of day wick forms from manipulation of the Asian range, creating a protected swing within the candle to expand away from forming the candle body. Pair this manipulation with SMT.

### Ideal New York Reversal

Ideal New York reversal profile occurs when the previous sessions consolidates or retrace. The high or low of day wick forms from manipulation of the 1H/4H swing high or low, creating a protected swing within the candle to expand away from which forms the candle body. Pair manipulation with volatility driver or SMT.

## Wick Size

Expansion is supported by small opposing wicks.

Fading a large opposing run requires a very specific framework.


Below is an example of a large opposing run.

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_6_1.avif)

When fading a large opposing run, the candle must open and form a low first as this supports a bullish candle. The high of day should form early into the candle such as the Asia session, minimizing the time it takes to form the wick and allowing for more expansion.

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_6_2.avif)

Since price created a large opposing run, it does not support an expansion candle. Therefore, adjust the targets back to the opening price or back within the daily range as price is unlikely to expand past the daily open.

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_6_3.avif)

The high or low of day should form from a key level before 10:00, providing enough time for price to expand back to the daily open. Pair this with a volatility driver and SMT for reversal to add extra confluence.

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_6_4.avif)

Once price trades into a key level, we look to trade the 4H expansion candles away from the high or low of day back to the daily open.

## Targets

When a lower timeframe key level and target align with the higher timeframe target, it greatly increases the probability of success.

Aim to trade away from the lower timeframe key levels before the lower timeframe targets are met, managing the position towards the higher timeframe targets. After the lower timeframe targets are reached, entries are no longer valid until price reengages a key level for continuation. Do not chase price.

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_7_1.avif)

In a bullish candle, the market opens, forms a low into a key level (LOD), leaving session highs behind as a target. The ideal position is within the daily wick, below the daily open. When the market trades into a key level, session highs should be available to target. This increases the probability of the daily candle expanding (OLHC), as there is no protected high to trade away from, making it the target.

In an IRL→ ERL model, the market retraces into a FVG (IRL), acting as a reversal point to expand towards the swing high or low (ERL).

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_7_3.avif)

In an ERL→ IRL model, the market expands into a swing high or low, acting as a reversal point to retrace into the FVG (IRL)

![](resource:assets/images/gxt/gxt_2_7_4.avif)

In the HRLR → LRLR or order pairing model, the market manipulates a swing high or low on one side of the range. Price then expands away from this side of the range towards the opposing side where resting failure swings await.
