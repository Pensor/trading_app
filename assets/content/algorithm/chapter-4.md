## Chapter 4

In this chapter, I'll break down **The Logic Behind My Entries** and how I pinpoint trading opportunities with precision.

If you truly understand how the algorithm works, you'll leverage it to get the best entries possible.

üîÅ**Every entry is also an exit**, and vice versa. If you recall Chapter 1, the algorithm always mitigates the highsand lows of the previous candle across all timeframes, applying the fractality of price.

We trade these **HTF** (High Time Frame) raids on **LTF** (Low Time Frame). This means, when the market shifts from a buy program to a sell program, it mitigates the high before moving down.

If we're in a buy, our exit point is precisely this high. For a sell, our entry is the exit of a buyer. This is the concept of algorithmic order pairing: every candle starting a move must be mitigated, creating opportunities for us to trade.

üí°During the price movement from the starting point to the Draw on Liquidity (DOL), the range is divided into **four quarters**. My strategy focuses on trading the first and last quarter.

Why? The **first quarter** provides **the most optimal entry**, minimizing drawdown and maximizing the risk-reward ratio.

The middle can cause retracements that might stop us out.

**The last quarter** is where price has mostly completed its move, offering a **final opportunity to join the trend** via a low-time frame raid.

![algo-4_2](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_2.avif)

Visual Example: Let‚Äôs visualize this with a **bullish example**.

Our **first buy** happens when the High Time Frame Draw on Liquidity (DOL) is mitigated. As the price reaches the previous low, we factor in time and the type of HTF raid.

**The second entry** occurs when a Low Time Frame raid happens, ensuring we enter as close to the start of the move as possible.

**The third entry** is when price fails to complete the HTF bullish DOL, giving us a chance to enter, albeit with a lower risk-reward.

In a bearish scenario, we apply the same concepts, but in reverse.

![algo-4_3](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_3.avif)

In a bullish case, **always buy on the buy side of the curve** to avoid drawdowns.
Trade during the **new candle hours**, except if a failure swing\* occurs at the end of the previous hour (explained in Chapter 3).

We never buy before the Turtle Soup has formed. You have two options: follow my **WS Time-Based Entry Model** or wait for confirmation entries, which I'll explain next.

![algo-4_4](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_4.avif)

How to Enter: Low Time Frame Raid WS Time-Based Entry Model Once you know when to enter, here's how: The Low Time Frame raid in my WS Time-Based Entry Model is the **most optimal entry**, always occurring after an HTF raid. If it captures the previous hour, that's even better.

For example, if this happens at 03:00, ensure the HTF raid has already been taken, followed by the 03:00 candle raiding the 02:00 high/low. Place your stop-loss to aim for a 3R reward toward your DOL without being stopped prematurely.

![algo-4_5](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_5.avif)

**Second Entry Type**: Order Block Confirmation If you're looking for confirmation entries, wait until a Swing High/Low has been mitigated by the HTF and previous hour‚Äôs candle on a Lower Time Frame. Look for an engulfing candle on a 5 or 15-minute chart that engulfs the candle forming the Swing High/Low. Enter when the next candle performs a PO3.

In a bearish case, enter when the candle touches the previous one, after it has closed below. This is known as the Order Block. Place your stop-loss above the high with at least a 5-pip margin.

![algo-4_6](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_6.avif)

**Entry Type #3: Last Quadrant** In the last quarter, wait for the price to fail at completing the HTF Draw on Liquidity, triggering a Low Time Frame raid within the final quadrant.

Here, we aim for a 1R or 2R profit, no more. Once the target is hit, exit the trade.

![algo-4_7](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_7.avif)

üö´**Where I Avoid Trading**: I avoid trading towards the **end of the hour**, except when a Failure Swing occurs, as detailed in Chapter 3.

I also avoid trading **halfway** between the start and DOL, as entering there can lead to a retracement that stops you out.

![algo-4_8](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_8.avif)

Real Example of Low Time Frame Entries:

- Entry 1: After a Low Time Frame raid follows the HTF raid.
- Entry 2: Price returns to the candle that created the Swing Low.
- Entry 3: When a Low Time Frame raid occurs in the first quarter towards the HTF DOL.

Always focus on the first and last quarter for the most optimal entries.

![algo-4_9](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_9.avif)

**Entry Patterns**:

This is what happens when you become a "**pattern trader**" without truly understanding how price moves.

In the first image, I apply Smart Money or ICT concepts, and we can see how, by only following patterns, we would be completely rekt.

In the second case, we apply the logic behind price movements, identifying the true Draw on Liquidity and understanding what the price is doing at a given time. At 4 o'clock, the Failure Swing is created, marking our ideal entry point.

![algo-4_10](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_10.avif)

üêëI'm sure all of you are trading the following: Turtle Soup, MSS, OTE retracement, or FVG, followed by the entry. The problem is, if you trade like everyone else, you'll get the same results as them.

ü•∑To be different and truly successful, you need to understand price action and focus on what really matters: **time, highs and lows**, the **Draw on Liquidity**, and the **economic calendar**. That‚Äôs what will give you the edge.

![algo-4_11](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_11.avif)

**High Time Frame Reversal Patterns**:

Let's see some **real reversal patterns** in **High Time Frame**. This is how reversal patterns manifest in candles on higher time frames

If you don‚Äôt believe me, I invite you to check for yourself. Study each **High Time Frame Reversal** and see how the candles behaved on lower time frames. Here‚Äôs some homework for you: look for the **Swing Highs** and **Swing Lows** on the 4hour chart, then drop down to the 1hour chart and find the entries on the 5minute chart using the concepts I just explained, applying the **WS Time-Based Entry Model**.

![algo-4_12](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_12.avif)

**Real Example of Low Time Frame Entries**:

Let‚Äôs look at another real example of entries on

1. The first entry is made once the Low Time Frame Write has occurred after the **High Time Frame Write**.

2. The second entry happens when the price returns to the candle that created the **Swing Low**.

3. The third entry takes place when a **Low Time Frame raid** occurs within the **last quarter**, heading toward our High Time Frame Draw on Liquidity.

Remember, as I mentioned before, we don't trade in the middle of the move. Although you might avoid drawdown in some cases, trading in the middle of the run will ultimately lead to losses. Focusing on the **first and last quarters** will always provide the most optimal entries.

![algo-4_13](resource:assets/images/algorithm/algo-4_13.avif)

**Stop Loss Placement**:

- Entry 1: Aim for **3R** from the LTF raid to your DOL.

- Entry 2: Place your **stop-loss just below the Swing Low**.

- Entry 3: Target a **1-2R** ratio, as you‚Äôre far into the move.
