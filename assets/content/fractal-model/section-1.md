## Using Opposing Candles

During an intraday expansion, anticipate price to respect opposing close candles to the objectives.


### Defining Opposing Candles

There are two principles to follow when marking out opposing close candles.

1. If there are a series of opposing close candles, use the opening price of the first candle in the series
Series of downclose candles: use the opening price of the highest downclose candle in the series
Series of upclose candles: use the opening price of the lowest upclose candle in the series

2. Ignore opposing close candles that are within a larger series of opposing close candles
Downclose candles within a larger series of downclose candles: focus on the larger series
Upclose candles within a larger series of upclose candles: focus on the larger series

### Where To Look For Opposing Candles

Opposing close candles should be supported by one of three points of interest; highs or lows, fair value gaps, and opposing close candles. Any opposing close candles which are not paired with a point of interest should be ignored and avoided.

Read on to learn about the three points of interest:


### Highs and Lows

Once either a high or low is swept, a closure through a series of opposing candles is the confirmation.

### SMT

Opposing close candles on the failure swing are used when an SMT is present.

### Fair Value Gaps

Once a fair gap is traded into, a closure through a series of opposing candles is the confirmation.

### Opposing Candles

Opposing close candles which form in respect to a previous series of opposing close candles. This is only used if there is no high / low or fair value gap to trade into.

### Measuring 0.5 of the Opposing Candle (CISD)

For a reversal to remain valid, it will remain in respect to the opposing candles that traded into the point of interest. Anchor a 0.5 fib retracement tool to the highest candle body to lowest candle body in the series:

When bullish, price should remain above 0.5 of the series of downclose candles

When bearish, price should remain below 0.5 of the series of upclose candles

To visualize this area, a rectangle can be used to highlight the range from the opening price of the series to the 0.5 level from the previous step.

## Framing Reversals

Reversals are framed at highs and lows and confirmed by the close through the opposing close candles which ran into the level.

Below are the two steps to this process:

## Using Fair Value Gaps

Fair value gaps are only used for two purposes:

## Using Discount and Premium

There are two ways discount and premium, or equilibrium is used in the model.


### Ranges

By using equilibrium of ranges, targets can be framed when trading back into the range. Equilibrium is also used to identify points of interest for trading out of the range.

When trading into the range, equilibrium is an objective.

When trading out of a range, equilibrium is a point of interest.

### Previous Candle Equilibrium

The main way equilibrium is applied within this model is by using equilibrium of the previous candle range or the previous candle wick. This will be discussed in further detail within upcoming lessons.


For reversals with large wicks, equilibrium of the previous candle wick is used as framework. The following candle should remain in respect to this level for a valid reversal.

For a continuation, equilibrium of the previous candle range is used as framework. The following candle should remain in respect to this level for a valid continuation.

## Determining Targets

As discussed in the previous lesson, equilibrium and liquidity can be used both as trade objectives and points of interest for a potential reversal. For the TTrades Model, the main focus for identifying targets is using standard deviation projections.

There are two ways to project the reversal:


### Manipulation Projection

Anchoring the projection will be done this way in the majority of scenarios:

Bullish: low to the previous high which made the highest high

Bearish: high to the previous low which made the lowest low

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_1_5_1.avif)

### Failure Swing Projection

The projection changes in certain scenarios when the manipulation leg is large. What is a large manipulation leg? When the projection is far overextended from any price logical objective for candle 3 or 4 to reach.

Bullish: lowest low to the high which formed the failure swing

Bearish: highest high to the low which formed the failure swing
