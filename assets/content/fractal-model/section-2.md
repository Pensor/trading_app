## Understanding Swing Highs & Lows
The market must form a swing high or low in order for price to reverse; there is no other way. Using that understanding is the foundation of the TTrades Model.

There are 3 candles that form a swing high or low. The focus will be on those 3 candles with the 3rd and 4th candles having potential opportunity following the swing high or low.

## Numbering Candles

Candle 1 will always be the candle before the high or low

Candle 2 will always be the candle that forms the high or low

Candle 3 will always be the candle following the high or low

Candle 4 will always be the candle following candle 3

Below is an example of numbering the candles:

## Reversal Candle Closure
This is the first of the two swing formations focused on within the model.

### Candle 2

- Bullish: takes the low of candle 1 and closes back above candle 1 low

- Bearish: takes the high of candle 1 and closes back below candle 1 high

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_2_1.avif)


With a valid candle 2 closure, there is an anticipation for candle 3 to expand.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_2_2.avif)


With a strong bearish or bullish closure on candle 3, candle 4 is likely to be a continuation.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_2_3.avif)


## Conditional Rule

This is the second of the two swing formations focused on within the model.

### Candle 3

Due to candle 2 failing to close inside the range of candle 1, more data is needed to determine if this is likely a swing formation. Allow candle 3 to form without participating, this is the best option in this scenario.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_3_1.avif)


If candle 3 closes through the opening price of candle 2, this validates the formation of the swing. Due to this closure on candle 3, candle 4 becomes a likely continuation away from the previously established swing point.

Below is what a candle 4 continuation looks like within this conditional scenario.

## Understanding Order Flow

Candle wicks and the equilibrium of candle ranges are crucial to the understanding of order flow. In this lesson, the use of equilibrium within the model is covered.

### Candle 2 Closure: Wick

With a candle 2 closure inside the range of candle 1, the wick is used to frame the candle 3 continuation.

Bullish: the upper half of the wick to support price higher

Bearish: the lower half of the wick to support price lower

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_4_1.avif)


Candle 3 remains in respect to equilibrium of the candle 2 wick.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_4_2.avif)


With a strong closure of candle 3 (outside candle 2) in respect to the wick of candle 2, candle 4 is a probable continuation. The framework is used by taking equilibrium of the candle 3 range.

Bullish: the upper half of candle 3 to support candle 4 higher

Bearish: the lower half of candle 3 to support candle 4 lower

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_4_3.avif)


### Candle 2 Closure: No Wick

With a candle 2 closure lack a large wick for framework, equilibrium should be taken using the candle range.

Bullish: the upper half of candle 2 to support price higher

Bearish: the lower half of candle 2 to support price lower

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_4_4.avif)


### Candle 3 Closure: Condition

With candle 2 failing to close back within the range of candle 1, candle 3 should be avoided.

Bullish: the upper half of candle 3 to support price higher

Bearish: the lower half of candle 3 to support price lower

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_4_5.avif)


Candle 4 expansion occurs in respect to equilibrium of the candle 3 range.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_4_6.avif)


### Highlighting Equilibrium

In reference to the Wicks & Equilibrium lesson above, price should respect:

Upper half of either the previous candle range or candle wick during bullish expansion

Lower half of either the previous candle range or candle wick during bearish expansion

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_4_7.avif)


The open of the current candle to the equilibrium of the previous candle is the area highlighted, the anticipation is that the following candle wick should form in the highlighted area.

Bullish candles cannot form its initial wick above the open and bearish candles cannot form its initial wick below its open. This is why the highlighted area is marked from the current candles open to the equilibrium of the previous instead of the entire equilibrium range.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_4_8.avif)


Repeat this process following candle 3 closing, anticipating the open of candle 4 to equilibrium of candle 3 to support price higher.

## Ideal Swing Formation

Coming from experience, this is the most ideal formation of a swing point.

Candle 2 closure back into the range of candle 1 with a large wick.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_5_1.avif)


Candle 3 expansion off of the wick of candle 2 with a strong close which validates the opposing close candle.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_5_2.avif)


Candle 4 continuation from both the opposing close candle and in respect to equilibrium of candle 3 range.

## CISD Confirmation & Projection

A candle 2 or candle 3 closure alone does not mean it is valid. A candle 2 or candle 3 closure must be paired with a lower timeframe change in the state of delivery (CISD) to confirm the swing point is valid.

Here there is a candle 2 closure, is it paired with a change in the state of delivery (CISD)

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_6_1.avif)


With the CISD marked out, the swing has been confirmed.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_2_6_2.avif)


Now projections can be added as a confluence as well as targets.
