## A Model For Any Timeframe

The TTrades Fractal Model is made up of three components:

1. Higher timeframe swing formations

2. Lower timeframe CISD confirmation and projection

3. Positioning entries within expansion candles


Candle 2 closure: finding lower timeframe entries within candle 3 and candle 4

Candle 3 closure: finding lower timeframe entries within candle 4


Below are the timeframe pairings to be used:

- Swing Point → CISD in Candle 2

- Weekly Swing Point → 4 Hour CISD

- Daily Swing Point → 1 Hour CISD

- 4 Hour Swing Point → 15 Minute CISD

- 1 Hour Swing Point → 5 Minute CISD

- 30 Minute Swing Point → 3 Minute CISD

- 15 Minute Swing Point → 1 Minute CISD


### Key Components

#### T-spot

The T-spot is where we look for the higher timeframe wick to form.

In a bearish scenario, look for price to open, form a high while respecting the T-spot, expand lower before forming a low and closing.

In a bullish scenario, look for price to open, form a low while respecting the T-spot, expand higher before forming a high and closing.

This T-spot is shown by marking the 0.5 of CISD as shown in the Opposing candles section and the 0.5 of the Equilibrium as shown in the Equilibrium section.

The goal of the T-spot is to locate Fair value gap, high/low, or if neither are present, an opposing candle for price to react off of and form the higher time frame wick.

Pairing this with the 0.5 of the Equilibrium

If they overlap, you can use the open of the current candle open to the overlap of the two, if they do not overlap, use the closer of the two.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_3.avif)


Generally speaking, there will not be overlap in a candle 4 continuation with the CISD. In this case, the T-spot is just the Equilibrium.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_4.avif)


As said above, the goal is to look for a point of interest in the T-spot to anticipate where the higher time frame candle will form its wick

### Intra-candle CISD (IC-CISD)

With the T-spot showing where a higher timeframe wick is likely to form, how can we confirm that wick to have formed? Just as a CISD was used to confirm the reversal and swing point, a CISD will be used to confirm the wick has formed. This is what I coined an Intra-candle CISD.

Waiting for an opposing candle formation within the specific higher time frame candle being traded.

If trading candle 3, wait for an opposing candle to form within candle 3

If trading candle 4, wait for an opposing candle to form within candle 4

This is allowing the upper or lower wick of the expansion candle to form and then catching the expansion move (body of the candle). Not trying to pick the high or low of the candle. 

With the T-spot marked out, anticipate the wick of candle 3 to form in this area. Wait for the wick to form, validated by a closure through the opening price in the upclose candles (opposing candles).

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_6.avif)


Now with a closure through the upclose candles, I can anticipate the wick of the higher timeframe candle to have formed. This is where entries are valid.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_7.avif)


If the initial entry is missed, that is okay. Now that all the timeframes are aligned in one direction, the entry sequence is valid. shown below are the various entries following the IC-CISD. Make notice at the beginning of candle 4, price reaches into a fair value gap, has an IC-CISD which forms the wick, and the expansion continues.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_8.avif)


### Entry Sequence

There are two potential entries to be taken under this model once price reaches a relevant point of interest.

The first is entering on the initial swing formation at the closure of candle 2 or 3 which starts the reversal. Swing entries prior to closing through the opposing candles provide higher reward, but come with greater risk as the high or low is yet to be confirmed.

The second is entering on the close through the opposing candles following the reversal. Entries on the opposing candle formation generally provide less reward, but are with less risk as the high or low is confirmed.

The following entry sequences are only valid at a relevant point of interest:

This is an example of a potential swing entry (candle 2 closure) as it provides great RR, but the high or low has not been validated with an opposing candle formation.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_9.avif)


With the close through the series of opposing candles, the high or low is confirmed and the invalidation point is provided.

Entry Sequence for Fair Value Gaps

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_11.avif)


Below are the ways to seek entries into the market:


### Candle 2 Closure Entry

With a valid candle 2 closure, enter on the opening of candle 3 with a stop loss on the candle 2 swing point.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_12.avif)


### Candle 3 Closure Entry

With a valid candle 3 closure, enter on the opening of candle 4 with a stop loss on the candle 2 swing point.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_13.avif)


### CISD and Opposing Candle Entries

Entering following the confirmation of a relevant opposing candle; either market on the opening of the first candle following the validation or a limit on the opposing candles.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_14.avif)


### Minimum Risk to Reward

2R is the minimum requirement before taking profit on an open position. Profit will be taken at projections, liquidity levels, opposing candles, and opposing swing formations.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_15.avif)


### Trailing Stop Loss

Stop loss will be trailed to opposing candles or validated swing points that should not be returned

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_16.avif)



Now returning to the previous example. Following the IC-CISD, there are numerous times the entry sequence forms, giving an opportunity to get onside with the move. The important thing to note is that an entry sequence always forms at a high/low, fair value gap, and only if neither are present will an opposing candle be used.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_17.avif)


### Step by Step Example

Here there is a candle 2 closure, now is there a CISD confirmation?

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_18.avif)


Annotate the CISD and anchor the projection for targets on the lower timeframe.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_19.avif)


In addition to this, mark out CISD of the candle 2 as well as the EQ of the wick on the higher timeframe. Price should remain in respect to equilibrium of the candle 2 wick and CISD in order to begin trading towards objectives. This is the T-spot.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_20.avif)


Subtract off any overlap / if there is no overlap, remove the further away marked region.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_21.avif)


Within this region, the higher time frame wick should form. Waiting for the IC-CISD to form. Now that this has formed, entries are now valid for the remainder of candle 3.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_22.avif)


Including the IC-CISD, there were two valid entry sequences that formed in candle 3. Now mark out candle 4.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_23.avif)


Marking out the T-spot in candle 4, is there a high or fair value gap that could form the higher timeframe wick?

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_24.avif)


Yes, there is a fair value gap.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_25.avif)


Now letting the IC-CISD form in candle 4. Entries following this are valid.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_26.avif)


Including the IC-CISD, there were two entry sequences available within candle 4.

![](resource:assets/images/fractal/fractal_4_1_27.avif)
